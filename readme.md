## 📝 About

This is a very basic chatbot implemented by **Aydie (aka Aditya Dinesh)**. It’s built using **Groq API** for lightweight LLM inference and a modern, conversational UI with **ChainLit**. The bot simulates a Zomato-style food ordering experience — helping users place orders, browse menu items, confirm delivery details, and view price summaries in a friendly, chat-based flow.
